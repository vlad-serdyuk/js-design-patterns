# Command


**Command** is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

## Problem
The Command design pattern solves problems like:

- Coupling the invoker of a request to a particular request should be avoided. That is, hard-wired requests should be avoided.
- It should be possible to configure an object (that invokes a request) with a request.


## Solution
Good software design is often based on the principle of separation of concerns, which usually results in breaking an app into layers. 

## Example
The most common example: a layer for the graphical user interface and another layer for the business logic. The GUI layer is responsible for rendering a beautiful picture on the screen, capturing any input and showing results of what the user and the app are doing. However, when it comes to doing something important, like calculating the trajectory of the moon or composing an annual report, the GUI layer delegates the work to the underlying layer of business logic.
