# Proxy


**Proxy** is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

## Problem
The Proxy design pattern solves problems like:

- The access to an object should be controlled.
- Additional functionality should be provided when accessing an object.

## Solution
The Proxy pattern suggests that you create a new proxy class with the same interface as an original service object. Then you update your app so that it passes the proxy object to all of the original objectâ€™s clients. Upon receiving a request from a client, the proxy creates a real service object and delegates all the work to it.

## Example
Javascript has built-in Proxy object.
```text
  new Proxy(target, handler);
```
