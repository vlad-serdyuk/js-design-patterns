# Visitor


**Visitor** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

## Problem
The Visitor design pattern solves problem like:

- It should be possible to define a new operation for (some) classes of an object structure without changing the classes.

## Solution
The Visitor pattern suggests that you place the new behavior into a separate class called visitor, instead of trying to integrate it into existing classes. The original object that had to perform the behavior is now passed to one of the visitorâ€™s methods as an argument, providing the method access to all necessary data contained within the object.
