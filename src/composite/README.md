# Composite


**Composite** is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

## Problem
The Composite design pattern solves problems like:

- A part-whole hierarchy should be represented so that clients can treat part and whole objects uniformly.
- A part-whole hierarchy should be represented as tree structure.

## Solution
Composite should be used when clients ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. The greatest benefit of this approach is that you donâ€™t need to care about the concrete classes of objects that compose the tree.

## Example
It is a bit complex to visualize this pattern. The easiest way to think about this is with the example of a multi-level menu. Each node can be a distinct option or it can be a menu itself which has multiple options as its child. A node component with children is a composite component while a node component without any child is a leaf component.
