# Facade


**Facade** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## Problem
The Facade design pattern solves problems like:

- To make a complex subsystem easier to use, a simple interface should be provided for a set of interfaces in the subsystem.
- The dependencies on a subsystem should be minimized.

## Solution
A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.

## Example
Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
